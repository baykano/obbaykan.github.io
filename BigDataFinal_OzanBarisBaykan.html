/* This file is a compatability layer.  It allows the usage of flexible box 
model layouts accross multiple browsers, including older browsers.  The newest,
universal implementation of the flexible box model is used when available (see
`Modern browsers` comments below).  Browsers that are known to implement this 
new spec completely include:

    Firefox 28.0+
    Chrome 29.0+
    Internet Explorer 11+ 
    Opera 17.0+

Browsers not listed, including Safari, are supported via the styling under the

You think I fuck this good without some practice?\nAnd if it&#39;s LOV and you&#39;re my MVP\nThen why we talkin&#39; about practice?\nLike you want me to lie\nWhy would I jeopardize my worth, just to value your pride?\nConfessions that I blame on the zodiac sign\n&#39;Cause then I switch up and I blame it on my Gemini\nMight be jealousy, &#39;cause you just want me tradin&#39; lives\nJealousy, &#39;cause I can get the girls and get the guys\nAnd if I&#39;m honest, this whole convo&#39;s just a waste of time\n&#39;Cause legacy should be my focus, not here playin&#39; wife&#34;</span><span class="ansi-bold">,

Did I?\nDid I lose you?\n\n[Verse 2: Drake]\nWinnin&#39; is problematic\nPeople like you more when you workin&#39; towards somethin&#39;\nNot when you have it\nWay less support from my peers\nIn recent years as I get established\nUnforgivin&#39; times, but fuck it, I manage\nWhy is my struggle different than others&#39;?\nOnly child that’s takin&#39; care of his mother\nAs health worsens and bills double\nThat’s not respectable all of a sudden?\nI don’t get a pat on the back for the come up?\nWhat do you see when you see me?\nWhen did all the things I mean\nFrom the bottom of my heart start to lose meaning?\nMaybe I share it with too many people\nBack then it used to just feel like our secret\nBack when I would write and not think about how they receive it\nI be tryna manifest the things I needed\nAnd look, now, I mean, it&#39;s hard to believe it even for me\nBut you&#39;re mindful of it all when your mind full of it all\nHow they go from not wantin&#39; me at all\nTo wantin&#39; to see me lose it all?\nThings get dark, but my aura just starts glowin&#39;\nI&#39;m overcome with emotions\nOnes I can&#39;t access when I&#39;m stoned sober\nJealous ones still envy and niggas turn king cobra\nI could only speak what I know of\nMan, we wrote the book on calculated thinkin&#39;\nAnd icy Heineken drinkin&#39;, and rival neighborhoods linkin&#39;\nAnd puttin&#39; your trust in someone with the risk of financially sinkin&#39;\nAll you did was write the book on garbage-ass Rollies\nEgo strokin&#39;, picture postin&#39;\nClaimin&#39; that you&#39;d do it for motivational purposes only\nBut you just had to show me\nSee, I know, &#39;cause I study you closely\nI know when someone lyin&#39;\nI notice people standin&#39; for nothin&#39; and gettin&#39; tired\nI know what we&#39;re both thinkin&#39; even when you&#39;re quiet\nSometimes I gotta just make sure that I didn&#39;t lose you\n\n[Chorus: Drake]\nDid I? Did I?\nDid I lose you?\nDid I? Did I?\nDid I lose you?\n\n[Outro: 600 Breezy]\nThis is the 6’s year\nSix hundreds instead of six, OVO\nYou know we’ll be rockin&#39; our asses out\nTo my big brother Drizzy\nYou know what I’m sayin&#39;?\nMore Life, 6 to the world, gang shit&#34;</span><span class="ansi-bold">,

I can appreciate where your uncertainty stems from and you have reason to question your anxieties and how disillusioned you feel, as well as feeling skeptical about who you believe you can trust. But that attitude will just hold you back in this life, and you&#39;re going to continue to feel alienated. Give some thought to this, because I’m confident in you, and I know you can reach your desired destination and accomplish your goals much more quickly without this confrontation I&#39;m hearing in your tone these days. When others go low, we go high.&#34;</span><span class="ansi-bold">,

Should I pinch you?\nAfter all the things that we been through, I got you\nLook what you&#39;ve done, look what you&#39;ve done\nLook what you&#39;ve done for me now\nYou knew that I was gonna be something\nWhen you&#39;re stressed out and you need something, I got you\nLook what you&#39;ve done, look what you&#39;ve done\n\n[Outro: Drake&#39;s Grandmother]\nHi Aubrey, I&#39;m here sitting with my son having a little talk—and he knows how to get in touch with you now, to let you know how grateful I am for your help in keeping me in this—in this comfortable place. All I can say, Aubrey, is I remember the good times we had together, and the times I used to look after you. And I still have wonderful feelings about that.

Can you see me? Get your Visine on\nY&#39;all just do not fit the picture: turn your widescreen on\nIf you thinking I&#39;ma quit before I die, dream on\nMan they treat me like a legend, am I really this cold?\nI&#39;m really too young to be feeling this old\nIt&#39;s about time you admit it, who you kidding?\nMan nobody&#39;s ever done it like I did it, uh\n\n[Chorus]\nI know way too many people here right now\nThat I didn&#39;t know last year—who the fuck are y&#39;all?\nI swear it feels like the last few nights\nWe&#39;ve been everywhere and back\nBut I just can&#39;t remember it all\nWhat am I doing?

Or is missing what we had out of the question?\nI&#39;m probably just the reason that you learned your lesson\nI got flows for the Marilyn Monroes\nWho was there before it all, I guess that&#39;s how it goes\nThey hear about your cons, but focus on your pros\nAnd love you for who you are from the bottom of their soul\nBut those same ones from your area will grow into women\nThat are ready to get married at hello\nBecause of what they allowed, where are they all now?\nI know they&#39;re somewhere watching\nSo I&#39;m trying to make them proud\nSearching for the meaning, you&#39;ll find it next to me\nThey tell me I&#39;m the hottest, guess we finally get to see\nI&#39;m feeling like Nas, who am I to disagree?\nThey say the doors will open up\nSoon as you find the missing key\nThat&#39;s probably why I&#39;m in this bitch shining\nJump up in the sky and put the stars into alignment\nI rep the ATF in case you need to be reminded\nAnd the bandwagon&#39;s full\nBut you can try and run behind it, I&#39;m sorry\nPoolside drinking, Margarita rounds\nShout out to my city though I hardly be in town\nI&#39;m the black sheep but Chris Farley wears the crown\nAnd I know life is just a game\nIn which the cards are facing down\nI&#39;m in a world where things are taken, never given\nHow long they choose to love you will never be your decision\nAnd I&#39;m aware that this could be the last time you listen\nSo while I&#39;m still here in this position\n\n[Chorus]\nYou could thank me now, go &#39;head\nThank me later, yeah I know what I said\nBut later doesn&#39;t always come so instead\nIt&#39;s okay, you could thank me now&#34;</span><span class="ansi-bold">,

You look very nice today, sorry, that&#39;s not professional, I guess. They say in Canada, don&#39;t mingle business with pleasure, or something like that So, we have to talk about Aubrey, or how he likes to be called, Drake. As I always like to say, there is room for improvement in his learning from piano. He talks a lot, huh? He socialize when I&#39;m teaching. Okay, and when it&#39;s time for him to play, he doesn&#39;t have pianist hands. If you need example: me, Mozart, and Ray Charles all of us have pianist hands. I&#39;m the only one living with this hands, I guess. Heh I&#39;m kidding, I&#39;m just kidding. Umm it seems like he likes the music and he obviously has a reason, but there is so much room for improvement, you know? Speaking of improvement, I don&#39;t think you, Ms. Graham need any of it.

laces get tighter and parka hoods flip up\nDrug dealers standing in their park or hood slip up\nWhere girls become exes from Summer&#39;s caught ho&#39;in\nThe winter cars come out, the summer cars go in\nAnd some places is breezy, and some it start snowin&#39;\nAnd if you planning family vacations you better know when\nBut some mothers scared to send they daughters out the city\nInstead she get a sweater that she bought her out of pity\nCause mom stays up late, she seen them videos\nWhere Cancun college students pouring water on their titties!\n\n[Drake talking]\nYeah man, it&#39;s a funny thing going through the winter up here man\nA lot of girls y&#39;know, wanna get close. you might think they the one\nBut just wait, nah mean, take it slow\n\n[Verse 2: Drake]\nForget to mention, this girl that never gets to the beach\nShe lives just West of my street, and so we destined to meet\nSince I&#39;m driving, I ask her how to get to the suite\nShe doesn&#39;t answer, opens the door and just gets in the seat\nShe throws her bag in the back, and starts adjusting the heat\nShe&#39;s bold but I roll with it, I&#39;m impressed cause she&#39;s sweet\nThen she says \&#34;I heard your song and I&#39;m obsessed with the beat\nI mean, the lyrics are good, but I&#39;m obsessed with the beat\nI love it when Voyce sings and the chorus is good\nThere&#39;s a couple things in the song that I suggest you repeat\&#34;\nOff this I&#39;m kinda taken back for a second\nI get her number she tells me to call her after this session\nAnd so I do, and it&#39;s kind of awkward, the surface hard to scratch\nUntil we end up sexin&#39; and now my heart attached\nI&#39;m thinkin off I should&#39;ve been more Southern\nAnd realizing all that she wanted was that indoor lovin&#39; and ho!\n\n[Drake talking]\nYeah, uh, I told ya&#39;ll I had a story for you right\nUh, ya man, it&#39;s what it is\n\n[Verse 3: Drake]\nAnd now, I&#39;m proud to have her like Montreal to the frizzench\nShe love to play hurt like Carter did on the bizzench\nBut, my boy say I&#39;m actin different, because I lay downtown\nAnd I still I rush to pick her up from work and fizzench\nShe tellin everyone I&#39;mma hold here down\nTell everyone I&#39;m the prince up in this cold clear town\nAnd stupid me I just listen to her\nInstead of wondering if this is really gon&#39; last me the whole year round\nBut then Spring shows up, and it&#39;s Dallas in this bitch\nThe weather starts to resemble the holidays she missed\nWhen we were together it seeming like way back when\nBall players hop on the plane and make it way back in\nSee she used to play piana, and now she never wait for santa\nInstead of saving for marriage, she saving for caribana\nAnd it&#39;s a shame, she had me convinced that she could&#39;ve been a dime\nI guess, I lost another one to the wintertime\n\n[Bridge (Drake talking)]\nI miss you, most of all, my darling [Beat fades out]\n(give me a second to gather my thoughts)\n[Fades back in] Strolling in the park (Ho!)\nAnd watching winter turn to spring (Such a beautiful day man)\n(Yeah man, you know we had to switch it on &#39;em right?)\nStrolling in the park and watching winter turn to spriing\n(I&#39;m still standing on two feet, even after this tragic loss)\n(Man, but I got something to else to tell ya baby)\n\n[Verse 4: Drake]\nI remember them encore PMs, breakfast and the wake up\nNow Drake&#39;s committed we waiting on the breakup\nSo we can get back to them cognac nights\nWith dress codes and light skinned girls that won&#39;t act right\nAnd I laugh cause my previous lifestyle was quite wild\nThe winter came and blew his cold air through\nBack then light sweaters and a couple drinks might get her\nBy the end of the week I would know that crew\nAnd we&#39;d assembled a trio, a whole new scene\nWith three ladies in the shot we never broke routine\nAt the end of every cut when the cameras are rollin&#39;\nWe had ladies hearts always gettin damaged and stolen\nBut this Summer is different it&#39;s a two man operation\nGranted the fact that we one man short\nGot love for him he can watch this new man stop a nation\nCause handlin&#39; crack is a one man sport\nInstead of dress-up, I walk in sweat pants and charms clinkin&#39;\nI find a girl we step dance and calm drinkin&#39;\nThe face, the breast, the bras, the toes\nI&#39;m still solo and a long night draws to a close\nCause it&#39;s a fact, if she come to the crib and I get some ass inside\nWe&#39;ll never talk again, scary and true\nThat song Special I recorded with Voyce well it&#39;s like a classified\nIt&#39;s what I&#39;m lookin for to carry me through\nYet I can&#39;t seem to find it, every girl that possesses it\nOnly wants a friendship causing me to forget the shit\nAnd when they talk about they past and lovers\nAnd you get mad at the thought of it giving ass to others\nYet you find peace with yourself, now least there&#39;s some room to ride\nThere&#39;s also Room For Improvement as soon as June arrive\n\n[Voice]\nStrolling in the park, and watching winter turn to spring\nStrolling in the park, and watching winter turn to spring\nStrolling in the park, and watching winter turn to spring&#34;</span><span class="ansi-bold">,
